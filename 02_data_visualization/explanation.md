## 1. ðŸ“Š Bar Chart â€” Revenue by Category

**What it shows:**  
Revenue values for different product categories.

**Why it's useful:**  
Clear comparison between categories, useful in financial or product performance dashboards.

```python
revenue_data.plot(kind='bar', x='Category', y='Revenue')

2. ðŸ“ˆ Line Chart â€” Monthly Active Users
What it shows:
User growth (or drop) across time, month by month.

Why it's useful:
Ideal for tracking trends like MAU, DAU, retention, etc.

python
Copiar
Editar
plt.plot(maus['Month'], maus['Users'], marker='o')

3. ðŸ¥§ Pie Chart â€” User Segments
What it shows:
Share of each user type in the user base.

Why it's useful:
Visual representation of user segmentation. Use with caution â€” pie charts are best with few, clearly separated categories.

python
Copiar
Editar
segments.plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.0f%%')

4. ðŸ”¥ Heatmap â€” Correlation Matrix
What it shows:
Correlation between numerical variables (from -1 to 1)

Why it's useful:
Helps detect multicollinearity, or find predictive relationships.

python
Copiar
Editar
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
