# ðŸ›  Feature Engineering Task

This module focuses on creating and transforming features to improve data analysis and modeling.

### Objectives:
- Extract new features from existing ones (e.g., dates â†’ year, month, weekday)
- Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding, label encoding)
- Perform binning on numeric data
- Apply transformations (log, standardization, normalization)
- Handle feature scaling for numeric columns
